> **Progress**: Started MIT 6.042J (Lec 1) and mastered the visual derivation of Linear Transformations.


#### 1. Logic & Proofs (MIT 6.042J Lec 1)
* **What is a Proof?**: A verification of a **Proposition** through a sequence of logical deductions starting from **Axioms**.
* **The "Induction" Trap**: Proving a case for $n=1, 2, ... 40$ does not constitute a proof for all $n$. Mathematics requires absolute logical necessity, not just patterns.
* **Gödel’s Incompleteness**: No set of axioms is both **Consistent** (no contradictions) and **Complete** (can prove everything). There will always be true statements that are unprovable.
