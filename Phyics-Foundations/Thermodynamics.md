# 🗓 2/8 Physics: Ideal Gas Law (PV=nRT)
> **Insight**: Using "Ideal" models to approximate "Real" complexity.

### 🌡 1. The Core Equation
- **Formula**: $PV = nRT$
- **Golden Rule**: Always convert Temperature to **Kelvin** ($K = ^\circ C + 273$).
- **The Ideal Assumption**: No intermolecular forces, zero molecular volume.

### 🏗 2. Practical Logic
- **Fixed Amount of Gas**: $\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}$
- **Unit Trap**: Match $P$ and $V$ units to your choice of constant $R$.

### 🧠 PhD Reflection (Modeling)
- Ideal Gas Law is a "Linear Approximation" of a non-linear reality. 
- In Economics (HEOR), we also use "Idealized Models" (like perfect competition) to understand messy market realities.

## 🌡 1. The Core Equation (Ideal Gas Law)
The state of an amount of gas is determined by its pressure, volume, and temperature:

$$PV = nRT$$

### Variables Breakdown:
* **$P$ (Pressure)**: Force exerted by molecular collisions. (Units: $atm$, $Pa$, $Torr$)
* **$V$ (Volume)**: Space occupied by the gas. (Units: $L$, $m^3$)
* **$n$ (Moles)**: Amount of substance.
* **$T$ (Temperature)**: Average kinetic energy. **Must be in Kelvin ($K$).**
* **$R$ (Ideal Gas Constant)**: 
    * $0.08206 \text{ L}\cdot\text{atm/mol}\cdot\text{K}$
    * $8.314 \text{ J/mol}\cdot\text{K}$ (SI Units)

## 🍗 2. The "KFC" Temperature Scale (K-C-F)
In physics, we use **Absolute Temperature** to ensure linear proportionality.

| Scale | Reference | Conversion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kelvin (K)** | Absolute Zero (Zero motion) | $K = ^\circ\text{C} + 273.15$ |
| **Celsius ($^\circ$C)** | Water Freezes at $0^\circ$ | $^\circ\text{C} = K - 273.15$ |
| **Fahrenheit ($^\circ$F)** | US Standard | $^\circ\text{F} = (^\circ\text{C} \times 1.8) + 32$ |

> **Warning**: Doubling $20^\circ\text{C}$ to $40^\circ\text{C}$ is **NOT** a doubling of energy. Only $K$ reflects the true energy scale.

## 📏 3. Pressure Units & Torricelli’s Legacy
The pressure of the atmosphere can be measured by how high it can push a column of liquid.

### The $P = \rho gh$ Calculation:
For Mercury ($\text{Hg}$):
* $\rho \approx 13,600 \text{ kg/m}^3$
* $g \approx 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2$
* $h = 0.76 \text{ m}$ ($760 \text{ mm}$)

$$P = (13,600)(9.8)(0.76) \approx 101,325 \text{ Pa} = 1 \text{ atm}$$

### Unit Equivalencies:
$$1 \text{ atm} = 760 \text{ Torr (mmHg)} = 101.3 \text{ kPa} \approx 10^5 \text{ Pa}$$

## 🧠 PhD Reflection: Economic Mapping (HEOR)
As a PhD candidate in Economics, these physical concepts map directly to modeling:

1.  **Idealized Models**: Just as $PV=nRT$ assumes no intermolecular forces, economic models often assume "Perfect Competition" to find a baseline.
2.  **PPP & Big Mac Index**: 
    * **Nominal Value ($^\circ\text{C}$)** vs. **Real Value ($K$)**.
    * Using a "Standard Particle" (Big Mac) to find the absolute purchasing power across different "currency temperatures."
3.  **Sensitivity Analysis**: Changing $T$ to see the impact on $P$ is equivalent to changing a cost parameter to see the impact on the **ICER (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio)**.
