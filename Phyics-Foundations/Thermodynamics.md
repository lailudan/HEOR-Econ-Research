# 🗓 2/8 Physics: Ideal Gas Law (PV=nRT)
> **Insight**: Using "Ideal" models to approximate "Real" complexity.

### 🌡 1. The Core Equation
- **Formula**: $PV = nRT$
- **Golden Rule**: Always convert Temperature to **Kelvin** ($K = ^\circ C + 273$).
- **The Ideal Assumption**: No intermolecular forces, zero molecular volume.

### 🏗 2. Practical Logic
- **Fixed Amount of Gas**: $\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}$
- **Unit Trap**: Match $P$ and $V$ units to your choice of constant $R$.

### 🧠 PhD Reflection (Modeling)
- Ideal Gas Law is a "Linear Approximation" of a non-linear reality. 
- In Economics (HEOR), we also use "Idealized Models" (like perfect competition) to understand messy market realities.
